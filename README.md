# ProcessManager
*A multiplayer game about killing processes on your computer!*

Every time you shoot a process, it will be killed. You can even play in multiplayer mode to kill processes of other users! Crash everyone as soon as possible, or try to kill as many processes as you can without destroying the system. Run with **sudo** for more fun.

Made as a little evening project on [WWW](http://warsztatywww.pl), inspired by [psdoom](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/psdoom-ng).
